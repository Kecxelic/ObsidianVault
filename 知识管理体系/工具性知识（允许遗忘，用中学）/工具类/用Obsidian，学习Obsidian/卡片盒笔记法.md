The "Card Box Method" (most famously represented by **Niklas Luhmann’s Zettelkasten Method**) is a note-taking system focused on organizing ideas for long-term thinking and knowledge creation. The four core classifications you’re referring to are a common modern adaptation of Luhmann’s original framework—designed to clarify the purpose and lifecycle of each note.  

First, it’s likely a slight mix-up: "fleeting project" you mentioned is probably **Fleeting Notes** (temporary, quick thoughts) rather than a "project." Below are the four standard classifications, with clear definitions, purposes, and examples:


### 1. Fleeting Notes (Fleeting Notes)  
The **"quick capture"** layer of the system—**temporary, unpolished notes** for capturing ideas, observations, or questions *in the moment* (before you forget them).  

- **Purpose**: Prevent "idea loss"—they’re not meant to be permanent, just a "placeholder" for thoughts that might be useful later.  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Short (1–2 sentences), messy, and unstructured.  
  - No need for sources, formatting, or links.  
  - Often written on scrap paper, phone notes, or a quick digital app (e.g., Notes, Notion Quick Add).  
- **Example**:  
  - "Idea: Link Luhmann’s ‘permanent notes’ to how writers avoid writer’s block—since they build on existing ideas."  
  - "Question: Why do some people struggle to turn literature notes into permanent notes?"  


### 2. Literature Notes (Literature Notes)  文献笔记
Notes taken **from external sources** (books, articles, papers, podcasts, etc.)—focused on distilling key提炼的关键词 information and your initial reactions.  


> [!NOTE] distill word remember
> distill,"dis" means split,still in latin language means drop.


- **Purpose**: Document what you’ve learned from others, while separating "other people’s ideas" from your own.  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Always include a **source citation** (author, title, page number, URL) to avoid plagiarism.  
  - Paraphrase (don’t just copy quotes) to ensure you understand the content.  
  - Add 1–2 sentences of your *own reaction* (e.g., "This contradicts what I read in X’s paper" or "This could apply to my project on Y").  
- **Example**:  
  - "Source: Luhmann, N. (1992). *Social Systems* (p. 45)  
    Key point: Knowledge grows not from isolated facts, but from connections between ideas.  
    My reaction: This explains why ‘linking notes’ is more important than just collecting them."  


### 3. Permanent Notes (Permanent Notes)  

> [!NOTE] Permanent
> means lasting,forever.And the word "perpetual" is the same meaning.

The **core of the Card Box Method**—polished, standalone notes that distill and develop ideas from Fleeting Notes and Literature Notes. These are the "building blocks" of your knowledge system.  

- **Purpose**: Create reusable, linkable ideas that can be connected to other notes (over time, forming a network of knowledge).  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Written in **full sentences, clear language**, and as a "self-contained idea" (someone else reading it should understand it without context).  
  - Linked to existing Permanent Notes (e.g., "See Note #123 on ‘idea connection’" or "Contradicts Note #45 on ‘isolated learning’").  
  - Stored in the main "card box" (digital or physical) and never deleted (they’re permanent).  
- **Example**:  
  - "Title: ‘Why Linking Permanent Notes Boosts Creativity’  
    Content: When permanent notes are linked, they create ‘idea combinations’—e.g., linking ‘literature note on habit formation’ to ‘fleeting note on workplace productivity’ leads to a new insight: ‘Habit tracking tools work better if tied to daily work routines.’  
    Links: Note #78 (Habit Formation), Note #92 (Workplace Productivity)."  


### 4. Project Notes (Project-Specific Notes)  
Notes **tied to a single, finite project** (e.g., a thesis, article, presentation, or work task). They are only relevant to that project and have a clear end date.  

- **Purpose**: Organize project-specific details that don’t need to be part of your permanent knowledge system.  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Focused on actionable tasks, deadlines, or project-specific questions (e.g., "Outline for Chapter 3" or "Interview questions for the report").  
  - Not linked to the main card box (or only loosely linked to Permanent Notes if needed).  
  - Archived (not deleted) once the project is completed (for future reference, if needed).  
- **Example**:  
  - "Project: ‘Essay on Zettelkasten for Students’  
    Content:  
    1. Deadline: Oct 15  
    2. Outline: Intro → 4 Note Types → How to Start → Common Mistakes  
    3. Need to add a case study: Student X’s experience with Fleeting Notes."  


### How These Four Types Work Together  
The system follows a clear workflow:  
1. Capture **Fleeting Notes** for spontaneous ideas.  
2. Convert relevant Fleeting Notes + **Literature Notes** (from reading) into polished **Permanent Notes** (linked to the card box).  
3. Use **Project Notes** to organize tasks that draw on Permanent/Literature Notes (e.g., writing an essay using your Permanent Notes on "idea links").  


This classification ensures your notes stay organized by *purpose*—preventing clutter and making it easy to turn scattered thoughts into structured knowledge.
